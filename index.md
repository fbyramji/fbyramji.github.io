# Farzan Byramji

I am a third year PhD student in the [UCSD theory group](https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Shachar Lovett](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~slovett/home.html) and [Russell Impagliazzo](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/). Previously, I was a student in the CSE department of IIT Kanpur, where I worked with [Rajat Mittal](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/) and got a BT-MT dual degree.

My research interests lie broadly in complexity theory and combinatorics. I am particularly interested in questions about propositional proof systems, Boolean circuits, decision trees and communication protocols.
